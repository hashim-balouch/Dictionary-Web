        <b>Profile system: </b>
        <p>
          I am adding a new profile system that will allow you to create and
          manage your own profile. You will be able to add your name, email
          address, and avatar, as well as follow other users and save your
          favorite words.

        <p>
          I am also developing a new user interface that is more modern and
          user-friendly. The new UI will make it easier for you to find the
          information you need, and it will be more accessible to users with
          disabilities.

Currently, my website is responsive to PC screens and mobile devices whose screen-width is between 380-450 px. This covers approximately 80% of all commercial and other mobile devices.</p></li>
